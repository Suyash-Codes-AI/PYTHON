👁️‍🗨️ OpenCV Learning Journey – From Beginner to Advanced

Welcome to my OpenCV Learning Repository!
This is a hands-on, structured guide for anyone starting out with Computer Vision using OpenCV and Python, with progressively advanced projects and notes. I created this repo to document my learning and help others on the same path.

📚 What You'll Find Here
- Beginner to Advanced OpenCV Concepts
- Hands-on Projects and Exercises
- Well-commented Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks
- Challenges to test your understanding
- Real-world mini-projects (Face Detection, Object Tracking, etc.)

🧠 Why OpenCV?
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful tool for computer vision applications like:
- Image and video processing
- Object detection & tracking
- Face recognition
- AR/VR applications
- Machine Learning with vision

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Tool               | Purpose                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Python             | Primary programming language     |
| OpenCV             | Core computer vision library     |
| NumPy              | For array/matrix operations      |
| Jupyter Notebooks  | Interactive learning             |
| VS Code            | Preferred IDE                    |
| Git & GitHub       | Version control & collaboration  |


🚀 Learning Roadmap

🔰 Beginner

- Drawing shapes & text
- Image transformations (resize, crop, rotate)
- Color spaces (RGB, HSV, Grayscale)

⚙️ Intermediate
- Filters: Gaussian, Median
- Edge detection (Canny)
- Contours & Histogram analysis
- Morphological transformations
- Bitwise operations and masks

🚧 Projects
- Face Detection using Haar Cascades
- Live Sketch App
- Real-Time Object Tracking with Color Filtering

🧠 Advanced
- Face Recognition with face_recognition or DNN
- Motion Detection & Background Subtraction
- Image Segmentation
- Integration with ML/DL models

📦 How to Run

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/opencv-learning.git
cd opencv-learning

# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run a script
python 01-Basics/reading_images.py

🌱 Tips for Beginners
- Start small: Don’t try to understand the entire library at once.
- Tweak the code: Change parameters and see what happens.
- Document your learning: Create your own mini-blogs or repos.
- Build projects: It’s the best way to solidify concepts.
