üì∑ Grayscale Histogram - In Short

A grayscale histogram shows how many pixels in an image 
have each brightness level from 0 (black) to 255 (white).

üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Create It:
1. Convert image to grayscale.
2. Count pixels for each intensity (0‚Äì255).
3. Plot intensity vs frequency.

‚úÖ Why It's Useful:
- Shows if an image is too dark or bright.
- Helps with contrast adjustment and image analysis.

#Histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of pixel intensities in an image.It is a list.Hist(gray, [256], [0, 256])

#In a histogram, a bin is a range of intensity values that are grouped together to count how many pixels fall into that range.'


gray_hist = cv.calcHist([gray], [0] , None , [256],[0,256])
