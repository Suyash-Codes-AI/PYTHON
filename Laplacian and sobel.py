# Apply Sobel operator to detect edges in the image.
# cv.Sobel() calculates the first-order derivative (gradient) of the image.
# This helps in identifying areas where the pixel intensity changes sharply â€” which are the edges.

# Parameters:
# - gray: Input image (must be in grayscale for edge detection).
# - cv.CV_64F: Output data type. 64-bit float allows for both positive and negative gradient values.
#              Using CV_8U (unsigned int) would clip negative gradients to 0, causing data loss.
# - dx and dy: Derivative orders in x and y directions:
#     - dx=1, dy=0: Finds the gradient in the x-direction (detects vertical edges).
#     - dx=0, dy=1: Finds the gradient in the y-direction (detects horizontal edges).
